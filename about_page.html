                                    develop Christian principles and make them disciples of Christ in their generation (Matt. 28:16-20). We are not only
                                    addressing or reaching out other children from perspective of religion or spiritual point of view but also from ethical

                                    Little Ark saw that religion has taken over of our responsibilities and yes, in contrary religion should stimulate us to do what we supposed to do as Christians. In other words going to church makes us to go to the
                                    needy. What qualifies us to do this, it is not by qualification (degree or doctorate) but by the fact that we too
                                    have lost our loved ones, grew up in single parent homes, and we have friends and family members who are
                                    affected by HIV and AIDS, hence we sympathise with them. We have developed programs that will stimulate them physically, mentally and spiritually. Little Ark Ministries feels that <strong>NOW</strong> is the time to go out, to
                                    touch and change someone’s life (Prov. 22:6). We don’t ask too much (John’s head), all we want is a
                                    child just to get into the boat. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour
                                    (Gen. 14:14, Eph. 6:4).

                                period of a year (see our work book). However, we also have extra material which is provided during
                                holidays like the Exodus, Moses, Joshua stories and the Sanctuary and its services (see our work book).
