                Only a few years ago, so did I. But I had no class, no audience, and NO IDEA what to do about it. Now, I have so much appointments, and have to turn down speaking gigs each month because I’m too busy to make them all.

                        We look at who is responsible and how? In this we look at the relationship between the teacher, parent and the child. We also look at the cognitive development of the child through learning.

                        Teaching is multidimensional and in that it involves many different domains. We often think of teaching in terms of academic or cognitive or religious domains. However, teaching also involves social, affective, moral and health domain, as well as many
                        other domains of child's life.

                        In as much as we are teachers; we are parents as well to our own; the training changed both our work and personal life in such a positive way. We acquired skills and tips in various aspects such as; control in a classroom; ways to make the learning fun
                        & memorable. Ps Peter is very experienced with total success from start to finish. The training was Informative Eye - Opening Covering all areas brilliantly. Giving us an opportunity to discuss issues openly. Open; honest without
                        prejudice, Entertaining & FUN I love the fact that is was practical and examples used we could relate to. As the church we have a syllabus formation session because of the insight we received during training. I recommend Little
                        Ark Ministries to all mom's & dads; Sunday school teachers. I will surely be worth your while plus give an opportunity to build a strong and lasting relationship with the children. Thank you

                        I was approached by church board members in January this year to be the children's ministry director. As clueless as I was I agreed cause you cannot say No to God's work. I heard about "LITTLE ARK MINISTRIES" and how good they are to people who are dealing
                        with kids, be it in schools or churches. I approached them to come and do the church programme for a day and the parents were so taken and blown away. I had to organise a training cause there was a lot that was interesting and
                        a lot that the parent and I (as a CHM director) was not doing right. We were taught on how to deal with different types of children as they all have different and all are different types of learners. Noah's Ark story was one of
                        the best stories that "LITTLE ARK" mastered (assuming their name was insipired by that story as well) ☺, the kids in my class as young as 4 yrs old can tell that story without being reminded or assisted, thats how good the "Little
                        Ark" is. We are looking forward to invite you to the next training so that we can gain some new teaching skills and more interesting stories🙏🙏

                        Good books for growing readers (the children) and adults too. They offer simple explanations to complex scripture passages. They make life so much easier. Imagine explaining the 7 seals to a toddler? Quite an exercise right? The breakdown on the 7 seals
                        workbook is amazing, as an adult I've too learnt a lot.
